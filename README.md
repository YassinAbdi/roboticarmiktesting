<!-- current goal test out pyweb3d

develop/understand ik 

create 3d printer controls potienally with gcode. -->


i decide to do some reverse thinking and realized that the fastest way to object of a 3d printer is to first start with microptyhon

- have a printed part
- parse and follow gcode
- be able to send over gcode file
- have a function stepper motor control and extruder
- get a websocket/web server going on esp32
